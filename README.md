## Temporary Demo Instructions for Aug 9


### Commanding Stretch using VLM Teleop
To begin the VLM Teleop demo, follow the instructions in the [<code>Running VLM Teleop</code>](##-running-vlm-teleop) Section below.

For each command/prompt, you must begin with "Amy". For example, "Amy, move forward 1 meter" will work.

VLM Teleop has 4 functions:
- **chat** - a simple conversation with Stretch
- **describe** - describes what Stretch's camera sees
- **move a certain distance and direction** - moves in a direction/turns by a certain distance or angle
- **move towards an object** - moves towards an object in the camera's current field of vision (this is very buggy and bad right now)

The code will automatically determine which function to perform based on the prompt you give. Simply begin to give your commands.



### Running VLM Teleop
You will need **3 Terminals open on the workstation** and **1 on Stretch**

On **Stretch**, run:
```
stretch_free_robot_process.py
stretch_robot_home.py

cd ~/ament_ws/src/lst_robot_dev/launch
ros2 launch the launch
```

On the **Workstation in the first terminal**, the following commands. This should activate the Speech to Text system. _**Make sure you see a blue spinner saying recording or transcribing after you run ```python3 new.py```**_ If you don't, close the terminal and run this again:
```
cd /repos/mic
source stt2/bin/activate
python3 new.py
```

On the **second terminal**, run:
```
cd ament_ws
source ./install/setup.bash
cd /src/lsy_laptop_dev
python3 vision_language_server_copy.py
```

On the **third terminal**, run
```
cd ament_ws
source ./install/setup.bash
cd /src/lsy_laptop_dev
python3 move_to_object.py
```

Everything should be running then, and begin giving your commands!

Run the following commands on Stretch and the workstation:

### On the Robot

Before running anything on Stretch, first home it using
```
stretch_free_robot_process.py
stretch_robot_home.py
```

### On the Workstation

```
# Run services, launch launches, run other scripts
```
